# INTERN-CAREER-PROJECTS
TASK 1 of my internship project at InternCareer ! I crafted a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard for global terrorism analysis**, diving into critical aspects like total attacks, success rates, fatalities, weapon usage, regional hotspots, and yearly trends. Grateful for this opportunity to contribute and excited to apply these skills in future ventures. Stay tuned for more data analytics insights! ðŸš€ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡

Task 2 of my InternCareer internship project ! This involved an in-depth exploration of the **'Covid_19 Daily Cases'** dataset using Excel and **Power BI** tools. The dataset, focusing on daily reported COVID-19 cases, encompassed crucial information like confirmed cases, deaths, vaccination, and testing data.

My primary objective was to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that not only summarized but visually presented key insights regarding the progression and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The process included importing the Covid_19 Database, data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers, removing unnecessary columns, and employing DAX functions to compute certain values.

Ultimately, the culmination of this endeavor was a dynamic dashboard equipped with slicers and filters, offering an insightful representation of pandemic trends and correlations within the data.
